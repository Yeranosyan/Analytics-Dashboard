# Dashboard Analytics

## Use React & Next.js 14

## In this project, I created my database on upstash.com. I implemented the Tremor library to display my chart dynamically, added some additional styles using Tailwind CSS, and used icons for my badges from the Lucide library. Additionally, I utilized react-country-flag to display country flags in a visually appealing manner. You can track your visitors with personal analytics
